## Introduction

#### Quotes from Foundations
"the missionary’s commitment to the six elements of the missionary task: entry, evangelism, discipleship, healthy church formation, leadership development, and exit." (Foundations, 14)

"The heart of the mission God has given us is to be His witnesses (Acts 1:8), to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name (Luke 24:47), and to make disciples of all nations and peoples on earth (Matthew 28:16–20)." (Foundations, 23)

"In light of the full testimony of Scripture, we believe that the core missionary task has six components: entry, evangelism, disciple-making, healthy church formation, leadership development, and strategically planned exit. Because prayer is central to our strategy, it is not a separate component of the task, but rather is an essential element in every part." (Foundations, 75)
