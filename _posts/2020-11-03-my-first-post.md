This is my first blog post on this new website. I made this one from scratch. I'm hoping to see how it works.

This is a really easy way to draft posts for a website. I think I could get used to this.

Even if I need to custom format suff, like this quote:
>Here is a very important quote.

I am interested in seeing how the paragraph styles work when I push this to Github. I am afraid, that it will not treat these as paragraphs. But, we will have to see what happens.
