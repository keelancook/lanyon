Pathways: IMB is a cooperative equipping cohort facilitated by churches in the Union Baptist Association in partnership with the International Mission Board (IMB).  Our hope is to streamline the process of onboarding new mnissionaries and simplify the application process for those wanting to go. The IMB has worked hard with our association to create a process that both meets their requirements and allows us the freedom to design a system that meets the unique needs of our churches.

The goal of this cohort is twofold. By combining a robust equipping process for missionary preparation with guided oversight in completing the IMB application, cohort members will both receive necessary training in order to succeed and the missionary task and have accomplished all the steps necessary for full application to the IMB. In other words, when someone completes this cohort, our hope is that they are both a well-trained missionary and have a completed application packet ready for trustee approval with the IMB.


## Equipped to be a Missionary

Missionary sending starts inside the local church. Instead of looking outside of our churches for people to go on our behalf, we want UBA churches to raise up missionaries right from their pews. This is how we multiply gospel laborers, by identifying our own members to send to the nations. Pathways > IMB will provide a path for your church members from pew to plane in the missionary journey. 

### Character, Calling, and Competencies
Cross-cultural disciple-making is a challenging task, and it requires a clear sense of calling, a character that is above reproach, and a specific set of competencies in order to engage in gospel witness across culture and worldview. Over the course of an intense eight months, this cohort will work to develop these three characteristics in the life of the potential sent out one.

### Transformative Equipping
Equipping that transforms a person requires more than a book study or a classroom lecture. Participants will be engaged in both classroom time and cross-cultural missions locally. Cohort members will work together to implement cross-cultural disciple-making among the many unreached peoples here in Houston. Furthermore, students will be required to develop a sending support network in their own church to serve as an advocacy and support team for them while they serve overseas.
