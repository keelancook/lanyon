## The Play-by-Play
This week was certainly an interesting time to deliver a child. Of course, present pandemic circumstances shifted hospital practices. Guests are not allowed, so just Meredith and I were able to be there for the birth. In fact, Nora (our first and Ezra's big sister) was not even allowed to attend. She stayed at home with the grandparents, and that brings us to the second set of interesting circumstances.

We live in Houston. Houston was [in the news](NEWS-SITE-HERE.com) quite a bit this past week due to inclement weather. Now, we're used to bad weather in Houston; we have a reputation for it. However, this was not our typical bout with mother nature. Instead of a hurricane, Houston suffered through something for which it is completely unprepared: an ice storm. You can douse Houston with enough water to fill one of the Great Lakes, and we'll rise to the challenge. However, if you sprinkle an inch of ice onto the city, you might as well uproot the city and toss it into the Artic Ocean.

I'll spare you the details, but along with the rest of Texas, Houston spent the better part of the week in temperatures significatly lower than freezing. Rain turned to ice, hail, and even snow. It crippled a city (and state) infrastucure not built to handle anything less than balmy. Rolling power outages, loss of water, and subequent boil notices insued.

Ezra was born at the height of snowmageddon, and while Meredith and I packed the dogsled for the hospital, the grandparents braved the storm at our house to take care of Nora. We booked a hotel near the hospital so we could still deliver the next day if the roads stayed impassible, only to get turned away from the hotel that day as the power grid failed. We lost power at our house that night. We left for the hospital again on February 16 (the exact day we moved to Houston four years ago) as Nora and the grandparents spent the next 24 hours with no power or water at our house in 15 degree weather. 

Ezra was born early afternoon of that day, and we spent the next two nights at the hospital. We emerged again with healthy baby, healthy momma, and full hearts. We're still boiling water.

## The Questions
1. **Did you know the gender?** No, we did not find out for Nora and loved the surprise, so we decided to the do same with Ezra. We didn't know he was a boy until shortly before you did.
2. **How did you pick the name?** *Charles* is a family name. My full name is Charles Keelan Cook, my father's is Charles Robert Cook. We wanted to continue this tradition with our first male child, if we had one. After considering the middle name *Danger*, we landed on *Ezra* instead. For those familiar with the Christian Scriptures, *Ezra* was a scribe and priest in the Old Testament. `Add more about Ezra and why we chose that biblical name.`
3. **Any questions concerning details of procedure?** `Do we want to discuss that it was a c section?`
